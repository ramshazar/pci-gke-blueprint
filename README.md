# PCI on GKE Blueprint

![high level project view](docs/diagrams/highlevel_project_view.png)

This is the companion repository to the [PCI on GKE Security Blueprint](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/blueprints/gke-pci-dss-blueprint) for the Google Cloud Platform. It
contains a set of Terraform configurations and scripts to help demonstrate how
to bootstrap a PCI environment in GCP. When appropriate, we also showcase GCP
services, tools, or projects we think might be useful to start your own GCP PCI
environment or as samples for any other purposes.

Here are the projects/services we make use of in this Blueprint:

- Terraform
- Helm
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Istio
- Cloud Armor
- Google-managed SSL Certificates
- [GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)

## Quickstart
We recommend you read through the documentation in [Building the Infrastructure](docs/build-infrastructure.md) and [Deploying the Application](docs/deploy-application.md) but if you just want to get started:
1. Follow the steps in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
1. Set-up the workstation.env file [Workstation Configuration](#workstation-configuration)
1. Run `./_helpers/build-infra.sh`
1. Run `./_helpers/deploy-app.sh`

## Prerequisites

Before starting, we need to make sure that our local environment is configured
correctly. We need to make sure we have the correct tools and a GCP account
with the correct permissions.

### Installation Dependencies
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx#installation)
- [helm, version 3](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/)

### GCP IAM Requirements

In order to execute this module you will need access to a Google Cloud Organization, with Organization Admin and Folder Admin permissions.

### Authenticate to gcloud

* Once the gcloud SDK is installed, run [gcloud auth login](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) to authenticate with your Google Account.


## Workstation Configuration

This project comes with a [workstation.env.example](./workstation.env.example) file that is intended to be copied and customized for your environment.

```
cp workstation.env.example workstation.env
```

You can find the values for `YOUR_ORG_ID` and `YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID` using the following commands:

```
gcloud organizations list
gcloud beta billing accounts list
```

To create a folder follow these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders).

Most variables can be left as-is, this is a list of the ones that are required to be set, see the comments in-line for details:

- `TF_VAR_org_id`
- `TF_VAR_gsuite_id`
- `TF_VAR_billing_account`
- `TF_VAR_folder_id`
- `TF_ADMIN_BUCKET`
- `TF_VAR_frontend_zone_dns_name`
- `GOOGLE_GROUPS_DOMAIN`
- `SRC_PATH`
- ` REPOSITORY_NAME`



You'll need to source your `workstaion.env` file before executing any of the steps in this Blueprint:

```
source workstation.env
```

* At this point, your workstation is ready. Continue from here by either running `./_helpers/build-infra.sh`, or following the
stepwise instructions for that script in [Building the Infrastructure](docs/build-infrastructure.md).

## Known Issues and Limitations

- If your GCP Organization is shared between other users or teams, consult your
  Organization Admins before building the Blueprint.
- This Blueprint does not implement a multi-environment setup. There is no
  "pre-prod", "staging", or "production" differentiation. However, there is no
  reason that this Blueprint couldn't be expanded to accommodate such a setup if you
  so choose.
- This Blueprint is meant to showcase various GCP features and act as a starting
  point to build a security-focused environment focused on PCI compliance. This
  Blueprint has been reviewed by [Coalfire](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/blueprints/google-cloud-pci-gke-review.pdf) but deploying an application into
  this environment does not qualify as being PCI-DSS compliant.
